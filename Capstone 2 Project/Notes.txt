Leaving in several columns just to be able to efficiently confirm and clean data, such as df_erupt - 'eruption_category'.  Once this column has been cleaned and purged this column can be dropped.
Others here: tectonic_setting (df_vol), 

Will need to condense the df_vol - rock_type col's data to provide less data, too much provided in the string.  Same for tectonic_setting, review and if this col isn't worthwhile drop.

Review volcano_type in df_vol, as there are variations of the same str.  Pay attn to this as it will effect your outputs.

*How do I want to merge the data?  Recordlinkage, 2 different joins, a couple concats?

? - How to handle multiple eruptions from the same volcano.  Just reindex based on VEI or another variable?

Go through eruption_type and drop any unconfirmed eruption rows as those cannot be counted towards the data. Then drop the column.

in the earthquake and tsunami columns change the values to T when present

Reset index when done merging

*** Can I even use the erupt dataset?  How do I tie in the scores and extra volcano names/eruptions to the rest of the data without years?  Think about this before I scratch entirely.
